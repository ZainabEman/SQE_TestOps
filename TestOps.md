# SQE  UI Test Automation Framework

Description of your project. This project includes automated testing with CodeceptJS using the Playwright helper, BDD with Cucumber, and data-driven tests that utilize Excel files for input.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Node.js is required to run backend scripts or develop in a Node.js environment.
- **Docker**: Docker is used to containerize the application and manage its dependencies cleanly.
- **Git**: Necessary for version control and to clone the repository.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Node.js

1. **Download Node.js**:
   - Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download the Node.js installer.
   - Choose the "LTS" version recommended for most users.
   - Download the installer appropriate for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Run the Installer**:
   - Execute the downloaded installer.
   - Follow the installation prompts, agree to the license agreement, and continue until installation is completed.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - This command should print the Node.js version installed on your system.

### Step 2: Install Docker

- **Download Docker**:
  - For Windows and macOS: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - For Linux: Follow the installation guide for your Linux distribution on the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

- **Verify Installation**:
  - Run `docker --version` to check that Docker is installed correctly.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

- **Clone the project repository** to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ZainabEman/SQE_TestOps.git
  cd SQE_TestOps
  ```

### Step 4: Run Docker Container

- **Build the Docker container**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t sqe_app .
  ```

- **Run the Docker container**:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 8080:8080 sqe_app
  ```

### Step 5: Install Project Dependencies

- Within the Docker container, or locally if developing outside Docker:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

### Step 6: Run the Tests

- To execute the test cases, use:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

### Step 7: Generate and View Test Reports

- Generate and open test reports using Allure:
  ```bash
  npx allure generate output/allure-results --clean
  npx allure open
  ```

### Step 8: Running the Application

- If the project includes a web server or application that needs to be run:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
```
